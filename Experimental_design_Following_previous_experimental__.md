# Experimental design
Following previous experimental literature on voting, we implement the following experimental design. There are two groups of voters, A and B, with NA= NB. Each session is composed by 50 periods. In each period people decide whether to vote or to abstain. Voting is costly. In particular, in each round, each subject has to decide whether to cast a vote for his own candidate or to abstain. The ones supporting the winning candidate (i.e. the candidate receiving more votes) receive five tokens while each supporter of the defeated candidate receive 1 token. Since voting costs 1 token there is no room for negative payoffs.  In case of a tie all participants get 2.5 points. 
Option A – Within and between subjects design
In order to focus on the use and effect of information about fraud on voter turnour, the level of fraud is exogenously imposed. When electoral fraud applies, one vote of the opponents` party is automatically subtracted. 
Option B – Between subjects design
